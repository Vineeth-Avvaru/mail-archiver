# Improvements

## Date Picker
- I felt that it would be better to use two date pickers for startDate and endDate instead of Date Range Picker
- In future if we also use time to filter mails the UI will be better with two separate date pickers.

## Date Reset
- It would be better to have a functionality that can reset the dates selected.
- User can reset the date filters directly from it instead of using the date filters again.

## Search Bar
- Search Bar and Date filters are separate.
- Search can be done with onEnter or Onclick.
- Reset search also available.

## Pagination
- Currently I added scroll to support the overflow of emails.
- But I think it would be better to make a limit for one page and add pagination to navigate.

## Mobile UI
- In the UI for table header the sort by date functionality should be added to "date"
- In Mock up the sort arrow is present beside "From", it should be beside "Date"

Note : I have already done the implementation with the above improvements. Please refer to it.
